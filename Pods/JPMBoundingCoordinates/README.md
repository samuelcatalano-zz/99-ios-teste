JPMBoundingCoordinates
==========

Finding Points Within a Distance of a Latitude/Longitude Using Bounding Coordinates.

About:
----------

Computes the bounding coordinates of all points on the surface of a sphere that have a great circle distance to the given point.
This code was ported to Objective-C directly from http://janmatuschek.de/LatitudeLongitudeBoundingCoordinates, and is owned by Jan Philip Matuschek.


## Usage
 - **[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org):**
```
pod 'JPMBoundingCoordinates'
```
 - **Manual:**
Copy `JPMBoundingCoordinates/JPMBoundingCoordinates` folder anywhere to your project and add it to XCode.


##Sample

```obj-c
#import "JPMBoundingCoordinates.h"

JPMSphericalTrapezium bounds = [JPMBoundingCoordinates boundsFromCoordinate:CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(55.750056, 37.615707) distance:1000];

// or
JPMBoundingCoordinates *boundingCoordinates = [JPMBoundingCoordinates fromCoordinate:CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(55.750056, 37.615707)];
JPMSphericalTrapezium bounds1 = [boundingCoordinates boundsWithDistance:100];
JPMSphericalTrapezium bounds2 = [boundingCoordinates boundsWithDistance:200];
```

`JPMSphericalTrapezium` is a C-struct with `southWest` (min) and `northEast` (max) locations.


## Compatibility
iOS 4.3 or later.
